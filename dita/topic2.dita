Exodus choreographers work hard to learn dances to a selection of k-pop songs, hold auditions to cast dancers, and teach them all their parts in each dance. They rehearse a few hours a week, all leading up to their showcase towards the end of the semester.</p><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Exodus logo, from Exodus YouTube account</title><image alt="The logo of &#34;Exodus at Virginia Tech,&#34; featuring the club's name in bright neon letters within a geometric design reminiscent of k-pop album covers." width="300" href="exodus2.jpg" class="- topic/image "/></fig><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Exodus workshop advertisement, from Exodus Instagram</title><image href="exodus.jpeg" class="- topic/image "/></fig><p class="- topic/p ">Exodus is an opportunity for people who haven't had a chance to dance before to learn exciting dances to songs they love. The theatre is always packed with friends and family, cheering for the dancers, and people dress up in styles reminiscent of k-pop artists. Many of these dancers are incredibly talented, and even those who never danced before hold their own incredibly well and seem to have a good time.</p><p class="- topic/p ">If you like k-pop or dance in general, you should be sure to check out the Exodus showcase. It's free, though you can contribute to the Exodus fundraiser by buying roses for dancers. </p></body></topic>
